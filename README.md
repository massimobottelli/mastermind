# Mastermind for LEGO Boost

More info at https://massimobottelli.it/coding/mastermind-lego/

In this project we will see how to make a Mastermind-inspired game using the motors and sensors in the LEGO Boost kit: https://amzn.to/40XNd4c


## The code

To program the game, I used the Pybricks platform (https://pybricks.com), a system for programming LEGO's SmartHub devices in MicroPython.

Unlike the LEGO Boost app, Pybricks loads the code directly onto the Hub, which can then run autonomously.


## How the game is built

The game is built using the LEGO Boost kit, using the components:

* MoveHub: the central unit with the batteries, processor and two motors that we will use to make the two flags move for the game's feedback
* Color sensor: an optical sensor that can recognize the colors of the tiles that the player places on the tray
* Motor unit: an additional motor that we will use to make the tray on which the player's tiles are placed move so that they all pass under the color sensor one at a time

## Game Rules

The goal of the game is to guess a sequence of three colors, randomly generated by the game.

The player prepares its own guess of the color sequence and places it on the tray: the game reads the colors proposed by the player, compares them with the mystery sequence, and for each color the game provides feedback by showing a flag:

* green flag: the color is in the correct position
* yellow flag: the color is present in the mystery sequence, but is not in the correct position
* no flag: the color is not present in the mystery sequence

Based on the feedback provided by the game, the player can modify its color sequence hypothesis and propose it again to the game, until the correct mystery sequence is discovered.
